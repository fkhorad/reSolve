  Key:
    - tag absent: the program did not attempt to read the parameter yet

      and found no default value (not a problem unless it still is =-1 at the end of the in
      file!)
    - value  1: the program attempted to read at least once, did not match the tag,
      but found and assigned a default value
    - value  0: a valid value was read for the parameter (can in principle be overwritten
      if the same tag is present twice in the in file by mistake)
